Counsel AI is a voice-based artificial intelligence assistant for mental health counseling.
The main aim of this project is to create a system that can provide real-time, emotionally expressive, and personalized mental health support to users through natural, human-like conversations.
In today’s world, mental health accessibility is still a big challenge. Many people hesitate to seek help due to stigma, availability, or cost barriers. Our project attempts to address this gap by designing an AI driven companion that is empathetic, responsive, and privacy-conscious.
